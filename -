# Project DetailThe Project Detail page is your central command center for everything related to a single job. Once a project is created, this page consolidates all floor plans, photos, documents, tasks, and other data so teams can coordinate from one place.## Accessing a Project- From the Projects dashboard, click the project name or open the context menu and choose View Project.- You’ll be taken to the Project Detail page, with the project title and key metadata at the top (client, address, status, etc.).## Key Tabs & FeaturesEach tab focuses on a specific aspect of the project:### Project AlbumsGroup photos into themed collections (e.g., “Pre‑Install Walkthrough”). Albums make it easy to share or review sets of images.### Project PhotosBrowse every image captured for the project. Add metadata, annotations, or tags to keep photos organized and searchable.### AttachmentsStore supporting files—blueprints, diagrams, inspection reports, or spreadsheets—in one place. Upload new documents or download existing ones for reference.### GalleryA visual grid of all photos and albums combined, ideal for quickly scanning through site imagery.### ProposalsDraft and refine statements of work or installation plans. Proposals can be exported or shared with stakeholders for approval.### ReportsGenerate formal reports based on collected data. Customize the output to include photos, site notes, or specific elements.### Site DataRecord measurements, coordinates, or other field notes. This tab centralizes survey data that doesn’t belong on floor plans.### Site ElementsPlace and manage system components (e.g., cameras, sensors) directly on floor plans. Each element can carry configuration details or installation notes.### Site SettingsConfigure project metadata, default permissions, or naming conventions. You can adjust project-level settings at any time.### TasksAssign action items, track progress, and resolve outstanding work. Tasks help teams stay aligned and accountable.### TicketsLog issues or requests tied to the project (e.g., “Need updated floor plan”). Tickets track problem resolution and communication history.## Tips & Best Practices- Use the Tabs Strategically: Encourage team members to store information in the most relevant tab (e.g., photos in Albums, documents in Attachments) to maintain clarity.- Leverage Permissions: Site Settings let you control who can view or edit each section, ensuring sensitive data stays protected.- Search & Filter: Many tabs include search or filter tools—take advantage of them to quickly locate specific files, photos, or elements.## Next Steps- Return to [Create a Project](create-project.md) if you haven’t set one up yet.- Explore [Project Albums](project-albums.md) and [Project Photos](project-photos.md) for deeper guidance on managing visual content.- Continue to [Site Elements](site-elements.md) to learn how to place devices on floor plans.
