What to expect

- Short form to describe your issue or question
- Optional project link for context
- File upload for screenshots or documents
- Confirmation email with a ticket number
- Email updates when there’s progress or a reply

Status

- The Submit a Request form is under active development. For now, please continue using your existing support channel to reach us.
