## 1.0.0-beta.1
**Planned Release date:** 09/29/2025

### Highlights
- Major multi-phase **UI/UX overhaul** completed, modernizing the look and feel of OneSurvey.  
- Standardized components and layouts across Projects, Surveys, Elements, Site Data, and OneSnap for a consistent experience.  
- New **user guides and documentation** launched to support onboarding and training.  

---

### New
- **Redesigned Floor Plan Survey page** with expandable sidebars, responsive canvas, and updated toolbars.  
- **Login & Forgot Password flow** redesigned, including new mobile-friendly pages and email templates.  
- **Clients Page** rebuilt with list layouts and simplified tabs.  
- **Active Session info** integrated into the Users page (last login tracking).  

---

### Improvements
- **Projects Page (Dashboard):** renamed and optimized with cleaner layouts.  
- **OneSnap Desktop:** refreshed styling, tabbed navigation, and alignment with new survey/gallery UI.  
- **Elements & Site Elements:** refactored for consistency, with favorite element selection and simplified menus.  
- **Gallery & Reports:** redesigned for better usability, including album creation, sharing, and improved previews.  
- **Navigation:** unified side navigation, sleeker project menus, and streamlined site settings.  
- **Mobile app (OneSurvey & OneSnap):** updated with new components and scalable layouts for future features.  

---

### Fixes
- Inconsistent styling across modals, inputs, and popups resolved.  
- Addressed layout issues in survey canvas tools and project detail menus.  
- Improved responsiveness of project and site data pages.  
- Removed outdated/unused tabs (Tickets, Tasks, Proposals) and replaced with clear **“Coming Soon”** placeholders.  

---

### Breaking Changes
- Older **Onesnap/Floor Plan Builder** menus and gallery implementations removed or refactored; legacy links may not function.  
- Certain admin-only views (e.g., Active Session page) deprecated or folded into other areas.  

---

### Known Issues
- Some performance optimizations for very large floor plan images remain in progress.  
- Admin email change workflow is not yet supported (email field is read-only in profile).  
- Ticketing and Quality Check modules are placeholders and not yet functional.  
- No SSO or social login integration (yet)
- No floor plan builder UI for OneSnap.

---

### Upgrade Notes
- Users should **clear cached browser data** to avoid conflicts with updated navigation and layouts.  
- Admins should **re-train teams** on the new Survey toolbar and Projects page structure.  
- Documentation has been refreshed — see the new **User Guides** section for onboarding.

### Thanks
A huge thanks to everyone who contributed to the multi-phase UI cleanup and code refactor — especially the design and dev teams who delivered consistent styling, component reuse, and improved UX across the platform.
