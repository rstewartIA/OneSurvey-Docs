# Glossary

This glossary explains OneSurvey terms for end users. Each entry is written in plain language and links directly to the related help page when available.

## A

**Album**: A curated set of project photos grouped by topic, location, or phase (for example, “Pre‑Install Walkthrough”). Albums make it easy to collect only the photos you want to review or share. Learn more: [Project Albums](../projects/project-albums.md). See also: [Project Photos](../projects/project-photos.md), [OneSnap](../media/onesnap.md).

**Archive**: A read‑only area where photos or files are moved when they’re no longer actively used but should remain available for reference. Archived items can be restored if needed. Learn more: [Project Photos](../projects/project-photos.md).

**Attachment**: Any supporting file you upload to a project, such as drawings, spreadsheets, PDFs, or images. Attachments provide extra context for surveys and reports and stay with the project record. Learn more: [Attachments](../projects/attachments.md).

**Account Manager**: The primary owner of a project with full edit rights and responsibility for coordination. Account Managers typically invite teammates and clients, manage surveys and photos, and own final approvals. See roles: [Users & Roles](../organization/users.md).

## C

**Client**: A customer organization linked to your projects. Clients help you group related surveys, photos, and reports, and control who can access shared data. Learn more: [Clients](../organization/clients.md).

**Collaborator**: A team member who can add or edit project data but doesn’t have full administrative control. Typical collaborators help with surveys, photos, and updates. Learn more about roles: [Users & Roles](../organization/users.md).

## G

**Gallery**: A visual grid showing all photos and albums in the current project. Use the gallery to browse, filter, and perform bulk actions on images. Learn more: [Gallery](../projects/gallery.md) and [Project Photos](../projects/project-photos.md).

## M

**Map**: A tab reserved for viewing geolocated photos within OneSnap. This feature is planned but not yet available. See: [OneSnap](../media/onesnap.md).

## O

**OneSnap**: The project photo hub used to capture, organize, and share site imagery across events and teams. From OneSnap you can browse photos, create albums, and include images in reports. Learn more: [OneSnap](../media/onesnap.md) and [Project Photos](../projects/project-photos.md).

## P

**Participant**: The area in OneSnap where you invite teammates or clients to an event and assign their role (for example, Viewer or Collaborator). Learn more: [OneSnap](../media/onesnap.md).

**Project**: The workspace that holds everything for a job site: surveys, photos, attachments, reports, and more. Projects keep all work organized in one place. Learn more: [Projects Overview](../projects/index.md).

## R

**Report**: A PDF or spreadsheet you generate to share project data or keep records. Reports can include photos, survey details, and element information. Learn more: [Reports](../projects/reports.md).

## S

**Site Data**: A tab that presents survey information and element metadata in sortable tables. Use Site Data to audit details and export structured information. Learn more: [Site Data](../projects/site-data.md).

**Site Elements**: The library of devices or components (for example, cameras or sensors) that you place on floor plans during a survey. Elements can be labeled and later exported in reports. Learn more: [Site Elements](../projects/site-elements.md) and [Drag & Drop Elements](../surveys/drag-and-drop.md).

**Site Settings**: The configuration tab for project‑level setup, including assigning team members and linking the project to a client. Learn more: [Site Settings](../projects/site-settings.md).

**Survey**: The floor plan–based workspace where you place elements, add labels and notes, and document site conditions or design intent. Surveys support versioning and exporting. Learn more: [Surveys Overview](../surveys/index.md) and [Canvas Basics](../surveys/canvas-basics.md).

## T

**Task**: An action item tracked within a project to coordinate work (for example, “Confirm camera locations”). Tasks help teams stay aligned. Learn more: [OneTask](../projects/tasks.md).

**Technician**: A field‑focused user who captures photos or places elements during surveys. Technicians typically have edit permissions for survey content. See roles: [Users & Roles](../organization/users.md).

**Ticket**: An issue or request logged in a project to track problems, questions, or follow‑ups. Tickets include status and activity to keep work moving. Learn more: [OneTicket](../projects/tickets.md).

## V

**Version History**: A timeline of saved survey snapshots. Use it to browse earlier layouts, compare changes, and restore a prior version if needed. Learn more: [Version History](../surveys/version-history.md).

**Viewer**: A read‑only user who can see project data without making changes. Viewers are useful for stakeholders who need visibility but not editing rights. See roles: [Users & Roles](../organization/users.md).

**Visibility Filter**: A canvas tool that shows or hides element categories to reduce clutter or spotlight what matters (for example, only cameras). Learn more: [Visibility Filters](../surveys/visibility-filters.md).
