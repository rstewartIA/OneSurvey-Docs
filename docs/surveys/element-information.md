# Element Metadata

Centralize details about each element so teams can design, install, and audit with confidence.

## Status
Track lifecycle state (e.g., Proposed, Approved, In Progress, Installed). Status appears on the canvas and in reports.

## Design Modal
Edit design‑time properties: labels, orientation, colors, and field‑of‑view parameters. See also: [Designing](design.md).

## Installation Modal
Capture install details: installer, date, mounting height/surface, photos, and notes. Values feed into [Site Data](../projects/site-data.md).

## Element Information Modal
One place to view and edit key attributes including IDs, part numbers, categories, and linked documents/photos.

## Delete
Remove an element and its attached artifacts (e.g., paths, comments) when appropriate. Deletions are tracked in [Version History](version-history.md).
