# Comments
Attach notes or voice clips directly to an element so every design decision has context. The comments panel keeps a running thread with author names and timestamps.

## Open the comments panel
1. Click an element on the survey canvas to reveal its mini menu.
2. Choose Comments. A sidebar slides in from the right showing the message thread for that element.
3. If no messages exist, the panel displays “No comments yet.”

## Post a text comment
1. Type in the “Write a comment…” field at the bottom of the panel.
2. Press Enter or click Send.
3. Your comment appears immediately with your name, avatar, and timestamp.

## Record a voice comment
1. Select the Mic button to begin recording.
2. Click the mic again to stop.
3. Review the optional transcription and edit if needed.
4. Press Send to upload the audio clip.
5. Each voice message shows playback controls, a waveform animation, and the clip duration.

## Manage messages
- Playback: use Play/Pause on voice comments to listen.
- Read more: long messages show a “Read more” link; click to expand or collapse.
- Delete: hover a message, click the ⋯ menu, and choose Delete. You can only delete your own comments.

## Tips
- Combine text and voice messages to capture detail and quick field notes.
- Comments stay linked to the element, making it easy to review decisions later.
- If you close the sidebar, the thread is preserved—reopen it to continue.
- Keep communication tied to the canvas so stakeholders have the full story behind each element.
