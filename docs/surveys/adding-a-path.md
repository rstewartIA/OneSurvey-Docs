# Adding a Path

Use Paths to illustrate cable runs or conduit routes between devices on the survey canvas. Each path is tied to a specific element, carries its own color and label, and automatically tracks the total length as you draw.

## Open the path panel
1. Click an element on the canvas to open its mini menu.
2. In the menu list, select Path to switch the sidebar to path tools.

## Create a line
1. In the Path panel, click Add Line.
2. The first segment appears with a start point anchored to the selected element and an end marker a short distance away.
3. Drag the end marker to trace the actual route on the floor plan.
4. The panel displays the current Path # and total length in feet.

## Extend the path
- Click Add Section to continue the run. A new segment begins where the previous one ended; drag the new marker to shape the path.
- Repeat to build complex routes around obstacles or through multiple rooms.

## Adjust color and label
- Color: choose a swatch from the palette to change the line’s color. The path updates instantly on the canvas.
- Path label: enter a label (e.g., “Cable Run to IDF”). The label appears in reports and metadata.

## Manage existing lines
- Lines for this element lists every path attached to the device.
- Click a line to select it and display its details.
- Use Delete Line to remove the active path.
- When a line is selected, the panel shows its total length and number of sections. Click Deselect to return to the list view.

## Tips
- Set the floor plan scale before drawing paths so lengths reflect real-world distances accurately.
- Use the Visibility Filters’ Show Path toggle to hide or reveal all paths while working.
- Keep path labels concise and unique to simplify reporting and troubleshooting later.

With paths, you can document precise cable runs or conduit layouts directly on the canvas, giving installers and reviewers clear guidance for every element.
