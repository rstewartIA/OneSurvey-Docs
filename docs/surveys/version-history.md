# Version History

Version History keeps snapshots of your survey so you can revisit earlier layouts, restore a prior state, or audit who changed what. Use it to experiment with alternate designs without losing your original work.

## Opening Version History

1. In the survey’s top bar, open the dropdown menu.
2. Select Version History (Layers icon).

This toggles a dedicated sidebar that temporarily replaces the element library. For navigation basics on the canvas, see [Canvas Basics](canvas-basics.md).

## Browsing Versions

- Each version appears in a chronological timeline with the name, author, and date.
- The active version is marked Current Version.
- Click a version in the list to load it on the canvas.

## Search

- Use the search bar at the top of the sidebar to filter versions by name, making older snapshots easier to find.

## Creating a New Version

1. Click Create New Version at the top of the sidebar.
2. Enter a version name in the modal and confirm.

The app duplicates the current survey and sets the new version as the active one, keeping earlier versions in the timeline.

## Managing Versions

### Rename

1. Open the version’s menu (three dots) and choose Rename.
2. Enter the new name in the modal to update the version label.

### Audit Log

- Select Audit Log from the version’s menu to review actions taken on that snapshot.
- A modal displays a filterable table of changes with timestamps and authors.

### Restore

- Choose Restore to clone the selected version as a new current version.
- This lets you roll back or branch off from earlier states without deleting history.

### Delete

- Use Delete to remove a non-current version.
- A confirmation modal warns that deletion is permanent.

## Tips

- Create versions before major edits to preserve milestones.
- Use descriptive names (for example, “Post-Review Layout”) to recall the purpose of each snapshot.
- Audit logs help track accountability and support compliance requirements.

With Version History, you can experiment freely, document every change, and restore the canvas whenever needed. For related workflows, see [Canvas Basics](canvas-basics.md) and [Drag & Drop Elements](drag-and-drop.md).
