# Designing

Fine‑tune elements after placement to match real‑world intent and clearly communicate design details.

## Swap
Replace an element with another from the library while preserving position, rotation, and relevant metadata.
1. Select the element.
2. Choose Swap.
3. Pick the new element from the library.

## Duplicate
Create a copy of the selected element, retaining label, color, and orientation.
1. Select the element.
2. Choose Duplicate, then drag the clone to its new location.

## Field of View (FOV)
Adjust the cone or coverage area for cameras and sensors.
- Width: set the angle of the cone.
- Depth: drag the range handle to extend or reduce reach.
- Angle: rotate to point the cone in the intended direction.

## Depth
For range‑based devices, set maximum effective distance. Depth updates in measurement units configured for the project.

## Angle
Rotate the element and any attached FOV to align with corridors, doors, or points of interest. Use snap increments for precision.

## Field Color
Change the color of the FOV/coverage area to improve readability on busy floor plans. Use contrasting hues across adjacent devices.

## Element Color
Set the icon/tile color used for the element marker. Colors help encode roles or statuses (e.g., proposed vs. installed).

Tips
- Use [Visibility Filters](visibility-filters.md) to isolate a category while designing.
- Combine Duplicate + Angle to quickly fan a set of cameras with evenly spaced coverage.
