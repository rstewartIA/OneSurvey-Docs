# Drag & Drop Elements

Placing devices on a floor plan starts with a simple drag. Elements can be pulled from either the Element Library or the Element List and dropped directly onto the canvas to mark their locations.

## 1. Start the Drag

On the left toolbar, open a category under “Universal Elements” or “My Library”.

- Click and hold an element tile.
- Begin dragging over top of the canvas.

### Touch Devices

On tablets or phones, tap and hold for a moment to trigger a drag.

- A floating thumbnail follows your finger.
- The original tile becomes semi‑transparent until the drag ends.

## 2. Drop on the Canvas

- Move the pointer (or your finger) over the floor plan.
- Release to drop. The map converts the drop point to precise coordinates and adds the element to the project at that location.
- Touch drags are converted into a synthetic “drop” so the element lands exactly where your finger lifts off.

## 3. Reposition & Customize

- Drag an element that’s already on the canvas to move it.
- Click an element to open mini popups for labeling, color changes, attaching photos, or adding installation notes.

## Tips

- Use the search bar in the sidebars to quickly locate specific elements.
- Favorites appear under the Favorites dropdown in the left toolbar for fast access.
- If elements stop responding to drags, refresh the page to reset the map’s drop zone listeners.

With drag‑and‑drop placement, your floor plans stay accurate and easy to update — just grab, drop, and document.
