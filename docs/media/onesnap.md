# OneSnap™

OneSnap is the project photo hub — collecting, organizing, and sharing field images in one place. Use it to track progress, build reports, or hand off visual context to downstream teams.

## Managing OneSnap Events

- The OneSnap page lists all events. Filter by name or add new events directly from the top bar.

## Gallery

Browse every photo in the current event:

- Select Mode — pick individual or all images.
- Create Album / Report / Archive / Delete — batch actions become available when photos are selected.
- Commenting — open a side panel to leave notes on any photo.

## Albums

Switch to Albums to view grouped photos. Selecting an album opens its photo grid while displaying the album name and photo count.

## Map

The Map tab is reserved for displaying photo locations. This feature has not been implemented yet.

## Reports

Generated photo reports appear in a sortable table. Each row lists details, type, timestamp, and creator with actions to preview, download, edit, or delete the file.

## Archive

Archived photos stay accessible in their own gallery so nothing is lost. Each item is marked as archived and still supports commenting.

## Participant

Assign the OneSnap event to a client and invite team members by role. Viewers can only see galleries, collaborators can edit and access the archive, and technicians can capture photos without album or report access.

## Floor Plan Builder

Start linking photos to floor plans or create new layouts for visual context. The Start Building button opens the builder interface, and existing floor‑plan versions are listed below.
