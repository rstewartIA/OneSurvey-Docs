# Creating an Account

## Overview
Most users are invited by an organization admin. This page covers sign in, invitation setup, and password recovery.

## Sign In Options
- Email and password.
- **Continue with Google** (if your sign-in page shows it).

## Invitation Flow for New Users
1. Open the invitation email.
2. Select **Join OneSurvey**.
3. Complete your profile.
4. Set a password (minimum 8 characters).
5. Finish setup and continue to Sites.

## What You Enter During Setup
- Required: first name, last name, password.
- Optional: phone, address, profile photo.

## If You Already Have a OneSurvey Account
If your email is already registered, your admin can still invite you to another organization. You keep the same login and gain access to the new organization.

## Forgot Password Flow
1. On the login page, select **Forgot Password**.
2. Enter your email.
3. Open the reset email and select the reset link.
4. Set your new password and sign in.

## Troubleshooting
- No invitation email: check spam/junk, then ask for **Resend invite**.
- Invitation link expired: ask your admin to resend. Invite links are time-limited.
- Password reset link expired: request a new reset link from **Forgot Password**.
- Missing sites after login: confirm the correct organization is selected in the app.
