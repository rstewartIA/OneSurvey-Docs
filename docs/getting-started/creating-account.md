# Creating an Account

## 1. Receive an Invitation
An administrator sends an invite to your email.

<div class="os-screenshot">
  <div class="os-screenshot-card">
    <img src="../../assets/images/invitation-email.png" alt="Showing invitation email that the user receives before logging in for the first time." loading="lazy">
  </div>
</div>
Open the message and click the Join OneSurvey link.
The link opens a registration form in your browser.

## 2. Complete the Sign-Up Form
Provide the required details:

- Email 
- Password

Click Create Account. A confirmation message appears when your account is ready.

## 3. Log In for the First Time
Return to the login page.
Enter your email and the password you just created.
Click Log In to access the OneSurvey dashboard.

## Troubleshooting
No invitation received? Check spam/junk folders or ask an administrator to resend the invite.
