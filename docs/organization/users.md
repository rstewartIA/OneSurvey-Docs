# Users & Roles

## Overview

User management ensures the right people have the right access across your organization. Each user is assigned a role, granting permissions that control what they can view or edit. Roles also govern access to specific modules, like OneSurvey or OneSnap, so you can tailor the app to different team functions.

## Available Roles

| Role | Typical Capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| Organization Admin | Full administrative control: manage clients, users, roles, and organization settings. |
| Account Manager | Oversee projects and surveys, manage attachments and reports, and invite collaborators. |
| Collaborator | Edit projects and surveys they’re assigned to, upload files, and adjust element metadata. |
| Technician | Field‑level access for capturing photos, commenting, and completing assigned tasks. |
| Viewer | Read‑only access for stakeholders who need visibility without editing rights. |

These roles correspond to the default role options included in the codebase for OneSurvey and OneSnap modules.

## Adding a User

- Go to Organization → Users & Roles.
- Click Invite User (or the “+” icon).
- Enter the user’s name, email, and username.
- Select one or more roles under OneSurvey or OneSnap.
- Click Send Invite. The user receives an email with login instructions.

## Editing or Removing Users

- Edit: Open a user’s row, adjust their details or roles, and save.
- Deactivate: Toggle the user’s status to prevent access without deleting their history.
- Delete: Remove the user entirely if they no longer require access (not reversible).

## Managing Roles

- Navigate to Organization Settings → Users.
- Assign the updated roles to users as needed.

Note: Role management is restricted to Organization Admins and Account Managers.

## Best Practices

- Principle of Least Privilege: Assign the lowest level of access needed for each user’s responsibilities.
- Review Regularly: Audit users and roles periodically, especially after team changes.
- Leverage Modules: Use separate roles for OneSurvey vs. OneSnap to keep permissions precise.
- Document Custom Roles: If you define custom roles, record their intended purpose so future admins understand them.

## Troubleshooting & FAQs

- Invite not received? Have the user check spam folders or verify the email address before resending.
