# Clients

Clients represent the organizations you serve. Each client can have multiple projects, surveys, or photo albums attached, letting you keep everything organized under a single entity.

## Adding a Client

- Go to Organization → Clients.
- Click New Client (or the “+” icon).
- Fill out the form:
  - Client Name — the company or organization name.
  - Primary Contact — optional contact name or title.
  - Address & Notes — any relevant location or description.
- Click Create to save.

## Viewing Client Details

- Select a client from the list to open its detail view.
- Tabs typically include:
  - Projects — all projects linked to the client.
  - Contacts — key people or stakeholders.
  - Notes — internal notes or reminders.

## Editing or Deleting a Client

- Open the client you want to modify.
- Click Edit Client to adjust name, contact info, or notes.
- Use the Delete action if the client is no longer needed.
- Deleting a client does not automatically remove associated projects — those must be reassigned or removed separately.

## Linking Projects to a Client

- When creating a project:
  - Choose the client from the Client dropdown.
  - If the client does not exist yet, select Add New Client directly from the dropdown.
  - Saving the project associates it with the client, so it appears in the client’s project list.

## Best Practices

- Use clear, consistent names for clients so team members can find the correct one quickly.
- Assign a primary contact and keep their details updated for smoother communication.
- Regularly review client lists to deactivate or archive entities that are no longer active.

## Next Steps

- Learn how to set up Users & Roles so clients and internal teams have the correct permissions.
- Navigate to Projects to create work linked to a specific client.
- Visit Organization Settings for company-wide configurations.
