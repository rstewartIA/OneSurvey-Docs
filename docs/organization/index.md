# Organization Settings

The Organization Settings page centralizes company branding and contact information so every project inherits the correct identity and details from the start.

## Branding

- Upload square and horizontal logos so documents and reports reflect your company identity.
- Recommended: provide a high‑resolution square icon for app chrome and a horizontal logo for report headers.

## Color Scheme

- Configure up to four color options used in exported reports.
- A tooltip explains where colors appear (for example, headings, accents, and table highlights).

## Contacts

Capture key contacts to keep communication details organized:

- Billing — name, email, phone
- Technical — name, email, phone
- Primary — name, email, phone

## Company Details

Record company information for accurate documentation and reporting:

- Company name and license number
- Phone and website
- Full address (street, city, state, postal code, country)

This setup ensures every project inherits the correct branding, color scheme, and contact information right from the start.
