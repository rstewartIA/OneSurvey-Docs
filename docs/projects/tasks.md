# Tasks (Beta)

> Coming soon — we’re building a fast, collaborative task experience to help teams stay aligned from survey through installation.

What to expect:

- Assign tasks to users and set due dates
- Link tasks to specific floor plans, site elements, or photos
- Track status with Kanban and list views
- Comment threads, @mentions, and file attachments
- Bulk updates, filters, and saved views

If you’d like early access, let us know which workflows you want to streamline and we’ll prioritize them for the beta.
