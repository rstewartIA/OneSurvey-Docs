# Reports

The Reports tab aggregates generated project reports, such as floor plan images or bill-of-materials exports, so you can review, download, or delete them in one place.

## Review & Download

Each row lists the reportâ€™s details, type, timestamp, and creator, with a one-click download button for the file.

## Manage Reports

Use the actions menu on any row to remove an outdated or incorrect report when needed.

These tools help keep project documentation organized, ensuring generated reports remain accessible throughout the project lifecycle.
