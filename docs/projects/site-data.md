# Site Data

## Overview

**Site Data** provides tabular views of element and survey information collected across the entire site. Use it to review, validate, and check data in bulk before generating reports or handing off a project. It is the best way to confirm completeness across all surveys at once.

## Tabs

Site Data has four tabs, toggled at the top of the page:

### Survey Information

A table of all elements placed across every survey on the site. Each row represents a placed element with its associated survey-level data — element name, type, label, status, survey name, and related fields.

Use this tab to:

- Confirm all elements have been documented correctly.
- Search and filter by element type, survey, or status.
- Validate coverage before running a Survey Data report.

### Installation Information

Installation-specific details captured for each element, such as installation status, access restrictions, technician notes, and timing information.

Use this tab to:

- Verify installation data is complete before a deployment phase or handoff.
- Filter by installation status to identify incomplete or in-progress items.

### Element Information

The custom data fields recorded for each element — such as model number, serial number, IP address, asset tag, or any other fields configured in your element library.

Use this tab to:

- Confirm key element data fields are populated before generating an Element Information report.
- Search for specific elements or field values across the full site.

### Bill of Materials

A materials summary based on the elements placed across the site, grouped by element type and quantity.

Use this tab to:

- Review totals by element type before generating a Bill of Materials report.
- Validate scope against the original project estimate.

## Filters and Search

Each tab includes a search field and filter options. Use the **rows per page** selector and pagination controls at the bottom of each table to navigate large datasets.

---

## Relationship to Reports

Site Data is a pre-report validation step. Once the data looks correct here, go to the **Reports** tab to generate and download the corresponding outputs.
