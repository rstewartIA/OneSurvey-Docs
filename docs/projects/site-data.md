# Site Data

Site Data consolidates every detail collected during surveys into a set of structured tables. Each tab focuses on a different slice of information, with filters, search, and export tools to help you refine and share what you need.

## Using the Three-Dot Menu (⋮)
Each tab’s upper-right corner includes a three-dot icon that opens an action menu. Common options like Save Spreadsheet Report and Save PDF Report queue exports; more advanced actions (for example, Edit Part Number) open modals for bulk updates. When an export is triggered, OneSurvey confirms the action and makes the file available in the [Reports](reports.md) section once processing completes.

With Site Data, you can slice, refine, and share survey information without leaving the project workspace—ensuring every stakeholder has the details they need.
