# Site Elements

## Overview

The **Site Elements** tab is the element library for a site. It shows all element types available to place on surveys, organized by category. Before starting survey work, use this tab to browse available elements and set up favorites for faster access during survey editing.

## Element Libraries

The tab has two libraries, toggled at the top:

| Library | What it contains |
|---|---|
| **Universal Elements** | Standard elements available to all sites in the organization. Managed by your organization's admins. |
| **My Library** | Custom elements specific to your organization, organized into super categories and categories. |

Both libraries organize elements in a hierarchy: **Super Category → Category → Elements**. Click a category header to expand or collapse it and reveal the elements inside.

## Searching Elements

Use the **Search element** field in the top-right corner to search across both libraries at once. Results update as you type and show matches from Universal Elements and My Library together.

---

## Favorites

The **Favorites** dropdown (top-right, shown as *Favorites X/20*) lets you bookmark elements for quick access on this site. You can save up to **20 favorites per site**.

### Adding a Favorite

1. Find an element in either library tab.
2. Click the **star icon** on the element tile.
3. The element is added to your Favorites list.

### Removing a Favorite

Click the **star icon** again on any favorited element to remove it.

The Favorites dropdown shows your current saved count (e.g., *Favorites 4/20*). Your favorites appear in the survey's element panel sidebar for fast drag-and-drop placement.

## Using Elements in Surveys

Elements are placed onto floor plans by dragging from the element library panel inside the survey workspace. The library in that panel mirrors the same Universal Elements and My Library shown here. Favorites appear at the top for quick access.

For step-by-step instructions on placing elements, see [Drag and Drop Elements](../surveys/drag-and-drop.md).
