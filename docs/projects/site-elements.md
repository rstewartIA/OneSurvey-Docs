# Site Elements

The Site Elements tab is your catalog of devices and components that can be placed on project floor plans. From here, you can browse the universal library, manage your own collections, and flag frequently used items as favorites for quick access.

## Browsing Libraries

Tabs let you switch between:

- Universal Elements — a shared library available to all users.
- My Library — elements curated for your organization or project.

Search filters the current library by element name so you can quickly locate specific items.

## Managing Favorites

- Click the Favorites button in the top-right corner to open the favorites dropdown.
- Use the star icon on any element to toggle it as a favorite (up to 20 items).
- Remove favorites directly from the dropdown when you no longer need quick access.

After an element is marked as a favorite, it automatically appears under the Favorites dropdown in the left toolbar of the floor plan for easy placement.

Favorites appear across both the universal and custom libraries, helping you build a personalized toolbox.

## Next Steps

- Open the [Canvas](../surveys/canvas-basics.md) to place elements onto floor plans.
- Review [Element Information & Metadata](../surveys/element-information.md) for editing properties once elements are on the canvas.
- Visit [Site Data](site-data.md) to analyze element details in tabular form.

The Site Elements tab streamlines how teams manage reusable components, ensuring consistent design and faster layout work across projects.
