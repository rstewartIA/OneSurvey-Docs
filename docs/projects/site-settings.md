# Site Settings

The Site Settings tab defines who has access to a project and which client organization it belongs to. Use this area to assign team members by role and ensure the project is linked to the correct customer.

## Team Assignments

Assign users to roles using the multi-select fields. For role definitions and permissions, see [Users & Roles](../organization/users.md).

Start typing in any field to search for available users, then click a name to add it. Selected users appear as chips; remove one by clicking the “×” next to their name.

## Client Organization

Link the project to a customer by choosing from the Client Organization dropdown:

1. Click the field labeled Client Organization.
2. Search or scroll to find the correct client.
3. Select it to associate the project with that organization.

Only one client can be linked at a time; switching clients updates the project’s ownership.

## Tips

- You can revisit Site Settings at any stage to adjust team members or client selection.
- Ensure required users already exist in your organization; see [Users & Roles](../organization/users.md) for managing accounts and permissions.
- Assign at least one Account Manager so project notifications reach the right person.

With team roles and client linkage configured, your project is ready for collaboration, data collection, and reporting.
