# Project Albums

Project albums group related photos — such as “Pre‑Install Walkthrough” or “Final Inspection” — so teams can view, share, and report on focused sets of images.

## Key Actions

- Browse albums with thumbnail previews and photo counts.
- Open any album to view its photo grid with selection and actions.
- Share album: generate a public link to send outside the team.
- Generate PDF report: compile all album photos into a downloadable report.
- Edit album: rename the album or adjust which photos it contains.

Albums help you maintain context around phases, locations, or systems, making it easy to review progress and communicate clearly across the life of a project.

## Creating and Managing Albums

1. From [Project Photos](project-photos.md), select one or more images.
2. Click Create Album and provide a name.
3. Add or remove photos later from the album view using the edit actions.

Tips:

- Use descriptive names (e.g., “Level 2 – Cameras” or “Final Punch List”).
- Keep related photos together to simplify reporting and sharing.
- Generate a report from the album when you need a portable PDF snapshot.
