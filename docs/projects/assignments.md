# Assignments

## Overview

**Assignments** track owned work items from creation through completion. They are used to assign specific tasks to team members, set ownership and priority, monitor progress, and keep execution work clearly accountable. Assignments can be linked to a specific survey or element so the assignee has direct context for where the work applies.
