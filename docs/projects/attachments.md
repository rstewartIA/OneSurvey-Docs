## Upload Files

## View Modes

Switch between Table and Grid layouts with the view toggle, letting you browse files by metadata or thumbnail preview.

### Table View

Displays file name, size, creation date, and action controls for renaming or deleting files.

### Grid View

Shows each attachment as a card with a thumbnail (for images) and a menu for rename or delete actions.

These tools help keep project documentation organized, ensuring files remain accessible throughout the project lifecycle.
