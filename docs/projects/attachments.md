# Attachments

## Overview

The **Attachments** tab is the site file library. Use it to store and share reference documents, drawings, specifications, and any other files the team needs during or after site work. Files uploaded here are available to all users with access to the site.

## Viewing Attachments

Use the toggle in the top-right corner to switch between two layouts:

- **List view** — Files displayed in a table with name, size, and action controls. Best for scanning a long file list.
- **Grid view** — Files displayed as visual cards with previews. Best for image or PDF files.

Your view preference is saved automatically and persists between sessions.

## Best Practice

Keep Attachments current. When files are updated — for example, a revised floor plan or a final spec sheet — upload the new version and remove or clearly rename the old one. Teams rely on this tab as a shared source of truth for project reference files.
