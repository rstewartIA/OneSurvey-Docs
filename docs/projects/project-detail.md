# Project Detail

The Project Detail page is your central command center for everything related to a single job. Once a project is created, this page consolidates all floor plans, photos, documents, tasks, and other data so teams can coordinate from one place.

## Accessing a Project
- From the Projects dashboard, click the project name or open the context menu and choose View Project.
- You’ll be taken to the Project Detail page, with the project title and key metadata at the top (client, address, status, etc.).

## Key Tabs & Features
Each tab focuses on a specific aspect of the project:

### Project Albums
Group photos into themed collections (e.g., “Pre‑Install Walkthrough”). Albums make it easy to share or review sets of images.

### Project Photos
Browse every image captured for the project. Add metadata, annotations, or tags to keep photos organized and searchable.

### Attachments
Store supporting files—blueprints, diagrams, inspection reports, or spreadsheets—in one place. Upload new documents or download existing ones for reference.

### Gallery
A visual grid of all photos and albums combined, ideal for quickly scanning through site imagery.

### Proposals
Draft and refine statements of work or installation plans. Proposals can be exported or shared with stakeholders for approval.

### Reports
Generate formal reports based on collected data. Customize the output to include photos, site notes, or specific elements.

### Site Data
Record measurements, coordinates, or other field notes. This tab centralizes survey data that doesn’t belong on floor plans.

### Site Elements
Place and manage system components (e.g., cameras, sensors) directly on floor plans. Each element can carry configuration details or installation notes.

### Site Settings
Configure project metadata, default permissions, or naming conventions. You can adjust project-level settings at any time.

### Tasks
Assign action items, track progress, and resolve outstanding work. Tasks help teams stay aligned and accountable.

### Tickets
Log issues or requests tied to the project (e.g., “Need updated floor plan”). Tickets track problem resolution and communication history.

## Tips & Best Practices
- Use the Tabs Strategically: Encourage team members to store information in the most relevant tab (e.g., photos in Albums, documents in Attachments) to maintain clarity.
- Leverage Permissions: Site Settings let you control who can view or edit each section, ensuring sensitive data stays protected.
- Search & Filter: Many tabs include search or filter tools—take advantage of them to quickly locate specific files, photos, or elements.
