# Site Detail

## Overview

Site Detail is the main workspace for a site. When you open a site from the Project List, you land here by default on the **Surveys** tab. All of the site's work — surveys, elements, data, files, photos, assignments, and tickets — is organized across tabs at the top of the page.

The page header shows the site name. Users with the appropriate role can rename the site directly from the header.

## Tabs

Site Detail contains the following tabs. Tab visibility depends on your role and seat:

| Tab | What it contains |
|---|---|
| **Surveys** | All surveys for this site. Create new surveys, open existing ones, and manage floor plans. |
| **Site Elements** | The element library for this site. Browse, search, and favorite elements before placing them in surveys. |
| **Site Data** | Tabular views of element, survey, installation, and bill of materials data across the whole site. |
| **Attachments** | Documents, drawings, and reference files uploaded to the site. |
| **Reports** | Generated report outputs ready for download or sharing. |
| **Gallery** | All site photos and albums. Upload, filter, organize, and build photo packages. |
| **Tickets** | Service issues and support tickets linked to this site. |
| **Assignments** | Tracked work items owned by team members. |

!!! note "Tab visibility"
    Users with a **Viewer** seat cannot access the Assignments tab. All other tabs are visible to all users with site access.

## Navigating Between Tabs

Click any tab name to switch views. The URL updates to include a `?tab=` parameter so refreshing the page returns you to the same tab.

Deep links can also open a specific record directly:

- A URL with `?tab=assignments&assignment=<id>` opens the Assignments tab with that assignment's detail panel open.
- A URL with `?tab=tickets&ticket=<id>` opens the Tickets tab with that ticket's detail panel open.

## Typical Workflow

The tabs support a natural project progression:

1. **Surveys** — Build floor plans, place elements, and keep element details current.
2. **Gallery** — Upload and organize site photos. Link photos to elements from within the survey or directly from Gallery.
3. **Site Data** — Review element and survey data in bulk before generating reports or handing off.
4. **Assignments** — Track execution work and team ownership during active phases.
5. **Tickets** — Log and resolve service issues or follow-up items.
6. **Reports** — Generate and download final deliverables.
7. **Attachments** — Store reference drawings, specs, and deliverable files.

## Access Notes

- **Archived sites** open in read-only mode. Content can be viewed but not edited.
- If you open a site that belongs to a different organization than your current one, the app will automatically switch organizations if you are a member of both.
- Users who are not members of a site's organization will see an access denied message.
