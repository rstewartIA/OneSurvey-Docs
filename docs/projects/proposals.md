# OneProposal (Coming Soon)

> Coming soon — OneProposal will streamline how you present project scopes, equipment lists, and estimated costs directly from within OneSurvey.

What’s ahead:

- Draft proposals using data you’ve already collected (site elements, photos, and notes).
- Customize line items and pricing to match client needs.
- Preview and export proposal documents in PDF or spreadsheet formats.
- Track proposal status (draft, submitted, approved) to keep stakeholders aligned.

Current status:

OneProposal is under development and not yet part of the production release. Keep an eye on the [Release Notes](../support/release-notes.md) for updates on when this module becomes available.

In the meantime:

- Use [Attachments](attachments.md) to store external proposal documents.
- Organize project details in other tabs — for example, [Site Data](site-data.md), [Site Elements](site-elements.md), and [Reports](reports.md) — to prepare for future proposal workflows.

Stay tuned — OneProposal will bring a seamless way to move from survey data to client-ready documents, helping your team close projects faster.
