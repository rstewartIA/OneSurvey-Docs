# Gallery

## Overview

**Gallery** is the site media workspace. All photos captured or uploaded for a site are organized here alongside albums for grouping, sharing, and reporting. Gallery has four views accessible from the controls at the top of the tab.

## Views

### Gallery (Default)

The default landing view shows a visual overview of recent photos and albums for the site. Use this as a starting point before switching to All Photos or Albums for more focused work.

### All Photos

Shows every photo uploaded to the site in a scrollable photo grid.

#### Filtering Photos

Use the **filter panel** to narrow the photo list. Available filters:

| Filter | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Search** | Filter by photo name or metadata. |
| **Floor Plan** | Show only photos linked to a specific survey floor plan. |
| **Element** | Show only photos linked to a specific element. |
| **Category** | Filter by element category. |
| **User** | Show photos uploaded by a specific team member. |
| **Stage** | Filter by the project stage recorded when the photo was captured. |
| **Installation Status** | Filter by the installation status of the linked element at capture time. |
| **Date Range** | Show photos captured within a specific date window. |

Applied filters can be cleared individually or all at once using **Clear filters**.

#### Selecting Photos

Click **Select Photo** (top-right) to enter selection mode. In selection mode:

- Click individual photo cards to select them.
- Use **Select All** to select every photo currently visible.
- Click the count button to deselect all.

With photos selected, click **Create Album** to group them into a new named album.

### All Albums

Shows all albums created for the site as a grid of album cards.

#### Creating an Album

Albums can be created two ways:

- Select photos in All Photos view and click **Create Album**.
- Use the **Create Album** button directly in the All Albums view and then add photos.

Give the album a name when prompted.

#### Managing Albums

Each album card has an actions menu (three-dot icon):

- **Rename** — Update the album name.
- **Delete** — Remove the album. Photos inside are not deleted, only removed from the album.

Click an album card to open it in Album Detail view.

### Album Detail

Opens a single album and shows all photos inside it. From here you can:

- Scroll through the album's photos.
- Add more photos to the album.
- Remove individual photos from the album (without deleting the photo from the site).
- Click any photo to open it in the full-screen photo viewer.

## Photo Viewer

Clicking any photo in Gallery opens a full-screen viewer. Inside the viewer you can:

- Navigate between photos using the arrow controls.
- Open the **photo editor** for annotations or basic adjustments.
- **Restore the original** if edits were previously applied.

## Photo Context Menu

Right-click a photo (or open its three-dot menu) for quick actions:

- Move or copy the photo to a different album.
- Change the photo's stage tag.
- Delete the photo from the site.

## Typical Workflow

1. Capture or upload photos during or after a site visit (via the survey element panel, Gallery upload, or OneSnap).
2. Use filters in All Photos to find photos by element, floor plan, date, or upload user.
3. Select related photos and create albums to group them by scope or handoff package.
4. Use albums when generating a Photo Report from the Reports tab.
