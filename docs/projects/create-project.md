# Create a Project

Creating a project is the first step toward organizing surveys, photos, documents, and tasks in one shared workspace. Follow this guide to set up a new project and prepare it for field work or design.

## 1) Navigate to Projects
- From the Dashboard, click Projects in the main navigation.
- On the Projects page, select New Project (or the “+” icon) to launch the creation form.

## 2) Enter Project Details
Fill out the required fields:

- Project Name: A clear, descriptive title (e.g., Downtown HQ Security Upgrade).
- Client: Choose an existing client or create a new one if needed.
- Description: Brief summary of the project’s goals or scope.
- Tags / Metadata: Optional labels for filtering and reporting.

Additional options may include project type, start date, or location, depending on your organization’s configuration.

## 3) Add Team & Permissions (Optional)
Assign users who should have access:

- Project Manager: Primary owner who can edit all project settings.
- Surveyors / Designers: Team members who will collect data or design on floor plans.
- View‑only Users: Stakeholders who can see project progress without editing.

Permissions can be adjusted later in [Site Settings](site-settings.md).

## 4) Upload Reference Files (Optional)
Before saving, you can upload supporting materials such as:

- Floor Plans in PDF or image formats
- Documents like scope notes or existing reports
- Photos for initial context

Uploads can also be added later via [Attachments](attachments.md) or [Project Albums](project-albums.md).

## 5) Save & Continue
Click Create (or Save) to finalize the project. You’ll be redirected to the [Project Detail](project-detail.md) page where you can:

- Add floor plans and place [Site Elements](site-elements.md)
- Capture [Project Photos](project-photos.md) and organize [Albums](project-albums.md)
- Track [Tasks](tasks.md), [Tickets](tickets.md), and [Proposals](proposals.md)
- Generate [Reports](reports.md) or share project access

## Next Steps
- Visit [Project Detail](project-detail.md) to explore all project tabs.
- Head over to [Upload Floor Plan](../surveys/upload-floor-plan.md) if you’re ready to start a survey.
- Review [Project Albums](project-albums.md) for managing photos and visual documentation.

With your project created, your team is ready to collaborate, document, and deliver work efficiently. Happy surveying!
