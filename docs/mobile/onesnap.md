# OneSnap Photo Capture

OneSnap Mobile gives you a streamlined list of photo events with search, client details, and project IDs so you can jump into the right gallery as soon as you open the app. A floating “plus” button is always available to open the **Create Gallery** sheet for naming a new photo event on the fly.

---

## 1. Open an Event
Tap a project card to enter its OneSnap event; the header keeps a back button and an edit icon so you can rename the event or return to the list without losing your place.

---

## 2. Work in the Gallery Tab
The **Gallery** tab shows the total photo count, a **Select Photo** toggle for multi-select, and an **Upload Photo** button for adding new images from your device when you’re ready to document the site.  
Each tile highlights the picture, label, description, upload date, uploader, and status icons (location and review alerts).

---

## 3. Manage Individual Photos
Tap the menu on a single photo to open options for commenting, relabeling, archiving, or deleting the image—complete with a badge showing how many comments are already attached.  
When you need to keep a note for later, use the **Comment** option; **Archive** and **Delete** both open confirmation prompts so nothing disappears by accident.

---

## 4. Bulk Actions with Select Photo
Choose **Select Photo** to enter selection mode; highlighted borders and check marks confirm which shots you’ve chosen.  
The bottom sheet that appears lets you create a new album from the selected photos, archive them, or delete them all at once.  
If you do start a new album, the follow-up sheet walks you through naming it or dropping the photos into a past album.

## 5. Build and Review Albums
Switch to the **Albums** tab to see curated collections, each with a cover mosaic, photo count, creator, and timestamp.  
The album menu opens **Edit** and **Delete** controls, plus access to a dedicated **Album Info** panel with creator details, date, and a **Copy Public Link** button for sharing.  
Open an album to browse its photos and access a bottom sheet for removing images from the collection without deleting them from the overall gallery.

---

## 6. Keep Track of Archived Shots
The **Archived** tab reminds you that no archived photos are available until you move images into storage, helping you separate retired shots from active ones.

---

## 7. Example Field Flow
1. Search for the project and tap its OneSnap card.  
2. In the **Gallery** tab, hit **Upload Photo** to attach today’s images and use the menu to leave a quick comment about each install.  
3. Turn on **Select Photo**, choose all completion shots, and create a new “Final Walkthrough” album so the office has an easy handoff.  
4. If a photo doesn’t belong, open its menu and archive it; the **Archived** tab keeps it available without cluttering the active gallery.  
5. Share album details (including the public link) right from the info sheet when the client calls in.

Following these steps keeps every field visit documented, organized, and ready for the rest of your team.
