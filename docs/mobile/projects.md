# Mobile Projects (OneSurvey)

The OneSurvey mobile Projects feature keeps field teams close to their work with searchable project lists, and survey tools including floor plan designs for documenting devices.

## Navigation & Layout

- The bottom navigation shows pages that can be accessed on Mobile. Navigate to the OneSurvey tab to see a list of projects you have been assigned to.

## Projects List

- The list opens with a welcome banner, a search field, and preloaded project cards that include the project name, client, lifecycle stage, and project ID for quick scanning.
- Tapping any card routes you into that project’s folder, ready to explore surveys, attachments, or site contact information.

## Project Detail Tabs

- A grid of the project's floor plans/surveys are rendered as cards with the names labelled on top. Tap on on to open the canvas and find elements.
- The Attachment tab previews files in tiled cards, giving you a quick glance at supporting documents tied to the project.
- The Info tab displays the address and site contact fields.

## Entering a Survey

- Selecting a survey card opens the mobile survey layout, which swaps between the element list and the element detail view based on the current selection.
- The element list displays each element type, with its label, status, and a camera action button to quickly snap photos.

## Floor Plan Preview & Controls

- An expansion menu displays on the bottom edge of the screen. Tap to collapse or expand the canvas. With the canvas expanded into view, you will see any element placements that have being included in the design, and you can tap on them to open the element detail menu.

## Element Details & Media

- Selecting an element opens an overview with its icon, label, and status, followed by a dedicated **Upload Photo** button for quick documentation in the field.​
- Tabs organize the element view into **Status**, **Photos**, **Fields**, and **Comments**, letting you switch between condition updates, media, metadata, and conversations without leaving the detail screen.​
- Comments use a thread component, so text and audio notes remain attached to the element for later review. You can leave a voice note, which is automatically transcribed after it is sent.

## Role-Based Responsibilities

- Mobile inherits similar role guidance used across OneSurvey: viewers can browse but not change content, collaborators can edit and upload photos, and technicians focus on capturing photos and updating information.

## Tips

- Ensure you have good internet connection (minimum 25mb/s) for best experience.
- Verify correct element placements from the desktop UI before visiting the site.
