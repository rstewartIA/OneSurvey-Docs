# Mobile Field Tips

OneSurvey Mobile is designed for quick, reliable updates while you’re on site. Use these tips to stay organized, capture accurate details, and keep your team aligned in real time.

## Before You Arrive
- **Sync your projects:** Open the Projects tab on Wi‑Fi so the latest surveys, attachments, and contacts are cached on your phone.  
- **Star priority work:** Use the search bar to find projects you are assigned to, and select the floor plan you are working on.

## On Site: Navigating Surveys
1. **Open the survey list** to see every element on the current floor. Status pills (e.g., Non-operational) and camera badges show what needs attention.  
2. **Tap an element** to switch into the detail view—no extra navigation needed.  
3. **Slide up the floor-plan preview** from the bottom sheet when you need to double-check room layouts or cable routes, then tuck it away when you’re done.

## Capture Photos Quickly
- **Use “Upload Photo”** at the top of the detail view for fast snapshots before you move on.  
- **Review the Photos tab** to make sure the image uploaded and to confirm metadata like timestamps and uploader name.  
- **Keep stages consistent:** If you’re documenting progress (e.g., moving from Pre-Design to Deployment), update the stage so reports stay accurate.

*Example:* After hanging a lobby camera, snap a picture with “Upload Photo,” then change the photo’s stage to “Deployment” so managers know it’s live.

## Update Element Details
- **Status tab:** Log the current condition—switch from “Non-operational” to “Operational” once a device is tested.  
- **Fields tab:** Capture structured data on the spot. For example, type the device’s IP address (`10.0.1.27`) or switch port number so network teams have it later.  
- **Comments tab:** Leave a quick text note (“Mounts to drop ceiling above reception”) or record a voice memo if your hands are full. The app stores the clip with your name and timestamp.

---

## Wrap Up Before You Leave
- **Scroll through the survey list** to confirm all red camera icons are cleared.  
- **Check attachments** if installers asked for drawings or manuals—download anything you need while you still have reception.  
- **Sync changes** by briefly returning to the Projects screen; the app sends updates over the network so office teams see your work immediately.

## Field-Proven Workflow
1. Arrive, open the floor plan preview, and walk the space.  
2. For each element:
   - Verify placement.
   - Upload a “live” photo.
   - Update status and fields (add IP, switch port, or notes).
   - Leave a comment if the installer needs follow-up.  
3. Head back to the list and move to the next device.

Following this loop keeps every element fully documented and ready for handoff—no spreadsheets or after-hours data entry required.
