# Cross-Platform Reference

OneSurvey is designed to work seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, giving teams the flexibility to prepare, survey, and document projects wherever they are.  

Each platform serves a different role: the **desktop** app handles setup and reporting, the **tablet** app mirrors nearly the full desktop experience for real-time field use, and the **mobile phone** app focuses on quick lookups, lightweight updates, and photo capture.

## Desktop: The Core Workspace

The desktop version of OneSurvey provides the full project management and editing toolkit. It’s where you:

| Task | Why use desktop |
| --- | --- |
| **Create and archive projects** | The Projects module supports complete project creation, editing, and version management. |
| **Upload and edit floor plans** | The full canvas with drag-and-drop placement, version history, and element configuration is desktop-optimized. |
| **Manage element libraries** | Build or edit reusable element templates and assign them to floor plans. |
| **Configure clients, users, and roles** | All organization-level permissions are managed from desktop to ensure secure access before field work begins. |
| **Generate reports** | Export formatted PDFs or spreadsheets from the Reports module after surveys are complete. |

## Tablet: Full Power, Portable Form

The **tablet interface** delivers nearly the same functionality as desktop—ideal for on-site walkthroughs, layout reviews, and real-time updates.

You can:

- **Drag and drop elements** directly onto floor plans in real time while walking the site.  
- **Upload or replace floor plans** without returning to the office.  
- **Edit project data, statuses, and element fields** as you go.  
- **Access version history and element libraries** just like on desktop.  
- **Use OneSnap integration** to capture, label, and attach site photos immediately to project records.

## Mobile (Phone): Lightweight Companion

The **mobile app** focuses on quick reference and rapid data entry rather than full project editing. It’s ideal when you need to check details or capture site photos on the move.

### What You Can Do on Mobile

- View **projects and site info** from the same searchable project list used on desktop.  
- Open any project to browse its **Surveys**, **Attachments**, and **Info** tabs, formatted for quick reading.  
- Review individual survey elements, check statuses, and add quick notes or photos.  
- Use **OneSnap Mobile** to upload progress photos, create or update albums, and comment on images.  
- Preview floor plans from the to confirm locations and document during site visits.

### Mobile Limitations

| Feature | Desktop | Tablet | Phone |
