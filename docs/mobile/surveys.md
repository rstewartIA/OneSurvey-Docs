# Mobile Survey Workflow (Phone)

OneSurvey’s mobile survey page is built around a two-step loop:  
1. Tap on a floor plan tile
2. Skim the element list for anything that needs attention.  
3. Tap an element to open its detail menu where you can upload photos, update status, edit fields, or leave a comment.  

After selecting an element, the app swaps from the the list to the detail screen, so you stay focused on one task at a time without losing floor-plan preview sheet at the bottom.

---

## 1. Browse the Survey List
- Scroll the element list to see every element on the current floor plan.  
- Each row highlights the **element type, label, and status**.  
- Tap anywhere on the row (or the camera shortcut) to jump into that element’s detail view.  

---

## 2. Open the Element Detail Menu
- When you select an element, the header switches to a detailed view with the following tabs:  
  - Photos
  - Comments
  - Fields
  - Status

---

## 3. Upload a Quick Photo
- Use the **Upload Photo** button near the top of the detail screen.  
- Snap a new image, or upload one from your device library.

---

## 4. Review the Photos Tab
- Shows every image tied to the element with:  
  - Thumbnails  
  - Timestamps  
  - Uploader names  
- Each photo card includes a **three-dot menu** for editing.  

---

## 5. Update Status
- Switch to the **Status** tab to record operational health.  
- A prominent **“Not Applicable”** pill shows the current selection.  
- Tap another option to log condition:  
  - Non-operational  
  - Semi-operational  
  - Operational  

---

## 6. Edit Fields (e.g., IP Address)
- Use the **Fields** tab to maintain structured data such as:  
  - Device labels  
  - Custom metadata (e.g. IP address, MAC Address, Asset Tag, etc.)  
- Inputs are **full-width and mobile-friendly** for easy typing on site.  

---

## 7. Comment or Record Voice Notes
The **Comments** tab mirrors desktop with threaded conversations, tuned for mobile:

- **Text Updates:** Type and send quick timestamped messages.  
- **Voice Notes:**  
  - Tap mic to start recording.  
  - Supports live speech-to-text.  
  - Auto-pauses when you stop talking.  
  - Transcript attaches with your message.  
- **Playback Controls:** Re-listen, track progress, and clean up clips after playback.  

Everything stays pinned to the element, so teammates can see (and hear) exactly what changed.  

---

## 9. Return to the List
- Use the **back arrow** to close detail view and return to the survey roster.  
- The app remembers your spot, so you can move directly to the next element without re-scrolling.

### Workflow Summary
With this flow—**list → detail → back**—you can walk a site, capture evidence, and update records on the go without losing track of your progress.
